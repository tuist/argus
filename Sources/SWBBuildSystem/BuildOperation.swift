Historically, Xcode built on a per-target basis and this was easy to provide, but it doesn't integrate particularly cleanly with how the low-level build system sees the world. In particular, the combination of dynamic work discovery and our desire to be able to process arbitrary subgraphs makes it difficult to easily identify the exact set of work for a target in advance.
    //
    // Instead, we rely on a system which assumes that once any work for a target has begun (i.e., one of its commands is preparing to run, even if it hasn't yet been scheduled), that there will always be at least one other command for that target preparing to run. Conceptually this makes sense because once started, a target cannot be complete until no part of it is waiting to build. In theory, the low-level system is capable of allowing us to subsequently discover additional work for a target, but we take care to assert that we never generate tasks that would actually do that.

        //      the index build description configures a target for all the
        //      platforms it supports within the same description, an output
        //      path that is platform-independent will end up the same for each
        //      configured platform. Given that the regular build is permissive
        //      with such script outputs, we should be permissive during an
        //      index prepare operation as well.
        //   2. A framework target has its product renamed to the same as
        //      another framework target's product. This duplicate tasks for
        //      the layout of the framework structure (mkdir and symlink),
        //      which all have the same inputs and outputs. For a project with
        //      modules enabled, the modulemap copy will also have a duplicate
        //      output (but separate input).
        //
        // For (1) we can recover by picking a producer an appropriate
        // configured target for the selected run destination. This will have
        // the same effect as if the user did a regular build of that target
        // for a particular platform.
        //
        // For (2) there's no "best" target to pick from.
        //

        // the latter case we should obviously fix it, but it would be nice if

        // an error here stops index preparation, which is catastrophic for
        // semantic functionality in the editor.
        //
